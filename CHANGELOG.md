# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — while
in `0.x`, minor version bumps may include breaking changes.

## [0.10.0] — Duplicate-id target resolution

### Added
- `_resolve()` now also supports `{ selector, index }` — picks the Nth
  element matching a selector that isn't unique on its own, combinable with
  `frame` for an element that's both inside a duplicate-id situation and a
  same-origin iframe. This is what
  [page-pilot-recorder](https://github.com/jyy1082/page-pilot-recorder)
  0.4.0+ produces for elements sharing a duplicate `id` attribute (invalid
  HTML, but common on real, messier sites) instead of falling back to a
  fragile structural path — recorded steps for such elements replay with no
  manual adjustment.
- `run()`'s frame-wrapping now also merges a step-level `frame` into an
  existing target object (one that already has `index` set but no `frame`
  of its own) instead of only wrapping plain strings.
- 3 new real-browser tests: resolving a `{ selector, index }` target
  correctly, a clear error when the index is out of range, and `index` +
  `frame` combined.

## [0.9.0] — Same-origin iframe support

### Added
- `_resolve()` (and every method built on it — `click`, `type`, `select`,
  `check`, `chooseOption`, `hover`, `dragTo`, `moveTo`, `step`) now accepts
  `{ selector, frame }` as a target, where `frame` is an iframe selector
  (or an array of them for nested iframes), resolving the selector inside
  that same-origin iframe's own document instead of the top page. `run()`
  automatically wraps a recorded step's string targets this way whenever it
  carries a `frame` field — the exact field
  [page-pilot-recorder](https://github.com/jyy1082/page-pilot-recorder)
  produces when it records interactions inside an iframe, so recorded
  steps replay with no manual adjustment.
- `waitFor()` also supports the `{ selector, frame }` shape for its target.
- A new `_topLevelRect()` helper converts an iframe-contained element's
  `getBoundingClientRect()` (relative to that iframe's own viewport) into
  top-level-viewport coordinates, by walking up through `window.frameElement`
  for however many iframes it's nested in. The cursor dot, click ripples,
  and highlight boxes all use this now, so they land in the right place on
  screen even when the target lives inside an iframe.
- A real-browser test suite (`test/browser-test.mjs`, `npm test`) covering
  click/type/select/check/waitFor inside a same-origin iframe, correct
  coordinate translation, a full record → replay round trip using
  page-pilot-recorder, and a clear error for a missing/wrong iframe selector.

### Fixed
- `_scheduleReposition()`'s "is this highlight's element still attached"
  check used `document.body.contains(el)` — always false for an element
  inside an iframe (it's never a descendant of the *top* document's body),
  which would have silently dropped iframe-contained highlights on the next
  scroll/resize. Now uses `el.isConnected`, which is correct regardless of
  which document owns the element.

## [0.8.0] — Block real input during the page glow

### Added
- `blockInteraction` (default `true`) — while the page glow is showing, a
  transparent overlay blocks real mouse clicks inside the glow area, so the
  person watching can't interfere with automation in progress. Set to
  `false` to keep the visual glow but allow real input through.
- `pointerBlockAllowlist` — an array of selectors that stay clickable even
  while blocked (e.g. a Stop button that happens to sit inside the
  glow-covered container).
- `pageGlowMessage` — an optional status label (e.g.
  `"Automation running — please wait…"`) pinned to the top of the glow
  area, shown and hidden in sync with the glow itself. Hidden by default.
- Demo updated to enable the message and allowlist the Stop/Reset buttons.

Verified with a 17-case test suite covering blocking, the allowlist
passthrough, the message, and `stop()`/`destroy()` cleanup.

## [0.7.0] — Rename to page-pilot

### Changed
- **Breaking:** renamed the project from `agent-cursor` to `page-pilot`.
  The exported class is now `PagePilot` (was `AgentCursor`), the error class
  is `PagePilotStopped` (was `AgentCursorStopped`), and the file is
  `page-pilot.js` (was `agent-cursor.js`). Update your imports:
  ```js
  // before
  import { AgentCursor } from './agent-cursor.js'
  // after
  import { PagePilot } from './page-pilot.js'
  ```

## [0.6.0] — Keyboard, hover, drag, and async waiting

### Added
- `pressKey(target, key, options)` — dispatch a real keydown/keyup, with
  optional modifier keys (ctrl/shift/alt/meta).
- `hover(target)` / `unhover()` — trigger mouseenter/mouseover and
  mouseleave/mouseout for tooltips and hover-driven UI.
- `dragTo(source, target, options)` — animated mousedown → mousemove →
  mouseup drag sequence, for mouse-event-based sortable lists, sliders, and
  drag widgets. Accepts an element or a raw `{ x, y }` point as the
  destination.
- `waitFor(target, options)` — poll for a selector (or predicate function)
  to match a visible element before continuing, instead of guessing a fixed
  delay. Supports `timeout`, `interval`, and `visible`, and is abortable via
  `stop()`.
- All four new methods work as `run()` step types (`pressKey`, `hover`,
  `unhover`, `dragTo`, `waitFor`).
- Demo updated with a hover tooltip, an Escape-to-close menu, a
  drag-and-drop chip, and an asynchronously-loaded "Load more" section.

Verified with an 18-case test suite covering all four additions.

## [0.5.0] — Container-scoped page glow

### Added
- `pageGlowTarget` — wrap the page glow around a specific container instead
  of the whole viewport, staying aligned to it across scroll/resize.
- `pageGlowRadius` — rounds the glow's corners, useful when wrapping a
  container that itself has rounded corners.

### Changed
- Demo's page glow now wraps the card container instead of the full browser
  viewport, since the demo's content is a narrow centered column.

## [0.4.0] — stop() and hardening

### Added
- `stop()` — immediately abort whatever's currently running (mid-wait,
  mid-typing, mid-scroll, anywhere) and drop anything still queued. The
  instance stays fully usable right after, no reset needed.
- `AgentCursorStopped` error class (later renamed `PagePilotStopped`) for
  distinguishing an intentional stop from a real failure.
- A Stop button in the demo.

### Fixed
- The page glow could get stuck on permanently after `stop()` interrupted a
  step mid-flight, due to an active-step counter drifting negative. Now
  clamped at 0.
- `stop()` interrupting a scroll (with `showScrollIndicator: true`) could
  leave the direction-arrow badge stuck on screen forever. `stop()` now
  cleans it up.
- Added a fallback for environments without `element.scrollTo()`, and made
  `contenteditable` detection more robust (checks the attribute as well as
  `isContentEditable`).

Verified with a 29-case test suite covering every public method.

## [0.3.0] — Page glow

### Added
- `showPageGlow` — a pulsing colored border around the whole viewport for
  as long as any step is running, a "the system is driving this" signal.
  Off by default. Configurable via `pageGlowColor` and `pageGlowWidth`.

## [0.2.0] — Broader form and framework support

### Added
- `check()` now supports custom ARIA switch components (`role="switch"` /
  `aria-checked`), not just native checkbox/radio inputs.
- `type()` now supports `contenteditable` elements (rich-text editors,
  custom div-based inputs), not just `<input>`/`<textarea>`.
- `showCursorDot: false` to skip the moving cursor dot entirely and keep
  only ripple/highlight feedback.
- `showScrollIndicator` (default off) to optionally show a small direction
  arrow during `scroll()`.
- `hideCursor()` / `showCursor()`; `run()` now auto-hides the cursor once a
  full sequence finishes.

### Fixed
- `select()` now uses the native property setter (like `type()` already
  did) so React-controlled `<select>` elements fire `onChange` correctly.

### Documentation
- Added a "Framework compatibility" section covering React/Vue behavior.
- Made the project description tool-agnostic (no longer references any
  specific third-party automation framework).

## [0.1.0] — Initial release

### Added
- Core interaction methods: `click()`, `type()`, `select()` (including
  multi-select), `check()` (checkbox/radio), `chooseOption()` (custom
  dropdowns), `scroll()` (window or container, by amount or to an edge).
- Animated virtual cursor with click ripple feedback.
- Persistent highlight borders on every acted-on element, with
  `clearHighlight()` / `clearHighlights()`.
- `run(steps)` to execute an ordered batch of steps.
- `step(target, action)` escape hatch for fully custom logic.
- Interactive `demo.html` covering every control type.

### Fixed
- A highlight box could jump to the top-left corner if the acted-on element
  hid itself as a side effect of being clicked (e.g. a dropdown option that
  closes its own menu).
- The demo's custom dropdown didn't open on the first click, due to a
  state-comparison bug against an unset inline style.
