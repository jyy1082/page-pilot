# page-pilot

**Version 1.0.1** · see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history

A dependency-free toolkit for visualized browser automation, in four
layers that live in this one repository:

| Layer | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | `src/page-pilot.js` | Plays back a step array with a visible animated cursor, click ripples, and highlight borders — so it's obvious what's happening and where |
| **Recorder** | `src/page-pilot-recorder.js` | Turns real clicks/typing/selecting into the exact step array the core expects |
| **Skills** | `src/page-pilot-skills.js` | Turns a recording into a reusable, named "skill" — specific values become named parameters you can swap out later |
| **Toolkit** | `src/toolkit.js` | A bookmarklet: drag one link to your bookmarks bar, click it on any site to get a record/run panel — no install, no extension |

Each layer only depends on the ones before it in this table — the core
engine has zero dependencies at all, the recorder only produces steps the
core understands, skills depends on nothing beyond the DOM, and the
toolkit ties all three together with a UI. You can use any layer on its own.

## Quick start — no code at all

**[Open the install page](https://jyy1082.github.io/page-pilot/demo/install.html)**
and drag the button there to your bookmarks bar. Click it on any site to
record a sequence of clicks/typing, save it as a reusable skill, or just
run a pasted-in step array directly. See "Toolkit" below for details.

## Quick start — as a library

```bash
npm install page-pilot
```

```js
import { PagePilot } from 'page-pilot'
import { PagePilotRecorder } from 'page-pilot/recorder'
import { detectParameters, saveSkill, fillSkillParameters } from 'page-pilot/skills'

const recorder = new PagePilotRecorder()
recorder.start()
// ...person interacts with the page...
const steps = recorder.stop()

const cursor = new PagePilot()
await cursor.run(steps) // plays it back with a visible cursor
```

---

# Core: page-pilot (playback)

Plays back a sequence of steps with a visible cursor, click animations,
and persistent highlight borders. It does **not** decide what to click —
it only animates and executes a step you already know you want, so you
(or the recorder, or the skills layer) stay in control of the actual
automation logic.

## Usage

```js
import { PagePilot } from 'page-pilot'

const cursor = new PagePilot()
await cursor.click(document.querySelector('#submit'))
await cursor.type(document.querySelector('#name'), 'Acme Corp')
await cursor.select(document.querySelector('#country'), 'US')
await cursor.check(document.querySelector('#agree'), true)
await cursor.chooseOption('#menu-trigger', '.menu-item[data-value="pro"]')
await cursor.pressKey('#search', 'Enter')
await cursor.hover('#info-icon')
await cursor.unhover()
await cursor.dragTo('#item-1', '#drop-zone')
await cursor.waitFor('#async-result', { timeout: 8000 })
await cursor.waitFor('#save-btn', { state: 'gone', timeout: 3000 }) // wait for something to disappear instead
await cursor.waitForFrameReload('#payment-iframe') // wait for a same-origin iframe to reload
cursor.destroy()
```

Or run a whole recorded/hand-written step array at once:

```js
await cursor.run([
  { type: 'click', target: '#submit' },
  { type: 'type', target: '#name', text: 'Acme Corp' },
])
```

## Target shapes

`target` accepts an `Element`, a CSS selector string, or an object
combining `selector` with:
- **`frame`** — for an element inside a same-origin iframe (a selector,
  or an array of them for nested iframes). Cross-origin iframes can't be
  targeted at all — that's a hard browser security limitation.
- **`index`** — to pick the Nth match of a selector that isn't unique on
  its own (duplicate `id`s happen a lot on real, messier sites).
- **`text`** — to match a button/link by its visible text content (native
  CSS has no "match by text" selector, so this fills that gap — often the
  most human-recognizable identifier a button has).

All three combine freely, including with `frame`. These are exactly the
shapes page-pilot-recorder generates automatically, so recorded steps
replay with no manual adjustment.

## Modals and overlays

Because clicks are dispatched straight to a resolved element instead of
through the browser's normal hit-testing, this library can click
"through" something a real mouse never could — most commonly a modal's
backdrop still covering the page. Set `verifyClickable: true` to check
for this before every click; it throws a clear error naming what's
covering the target instead of clicking through it. Provide
`onObstruction: async (blockingEl, targetEl) => boolean` to handle it
yourself (e.g. dismiss the modal) instead of erroring — return `true` if
you dismissed it (use plain `element.click()` in this callback, not
`cursor.click()`, or you'll deadlock the queue).

## iframe reloads

If a click causes a same-origin iframe to reload its own content
(embedded payment widgets, multi-step forms), `waitForFrameReload(selector)`
waits for its document identity to actually change, without needing to
know anything about the new content:

```js
await cursor.click('#refresh-iframe-btn')
await cursor.waitForFrameReload('#payment-iframe')
await cursor.click({ selector: '#new-btn', frame: '#payment-iframe' })
```

Or set `autoWaitForIframeReload: true` to have every click watch for this
automatically, with no explicit wait step — the right choice when you're
running steps you can't hand-edit (recorded/pasted JSON, a saved skill).

## Config (defaults)

```js
new PagePilot({
  color: '#378ADD', size: 16, moveDuration: 480, clickPause: 260, typeDelay: 45,
  respectReducedMotion: true, zIndex: 999999,
  showCursorDot: true, showScrollIndicator: false, showPageGlow: false,
  pageGlowColor: null, pageGlowWidth: 4, pageGlowTarget: null, pageGlowRadius: 0,
  pageGlowMessage: null,          // status label shown atop the glow area
  blockInteraction: true,         // block real clicks inside the glow area while it's showing
  pointerBlockAllowlist: [],      // selectors that stay clickable even while blocked
  highlightEnabled: true, highlightColor: null, highlightDuration: null,
  autoWaitForIframeReload: false, autoIframeReloadGrace: 400, autoIframeReloadMaxWait: 4000,
  verifyClickable: false, onObstruction: null,
  onExecuteClick: (el) => { /* pointerdown/mousedown/pointerup/mouseup/click sequence */ },
  onExecuteInput: (el, text) => { /* native-setter input */ },
  onBeforeStep: (step) => {}, onAfterStep: (step) => {},
})
```

## Known limits

- Native `<select>` dropdown menus, native date/color pickers — the popup
  itself is OS/browser-rendered, not in the DOM, so only the trigger click
  can be animated.
- File inputs (`<input type="file">`) can't be set by any script, for
  security reasons, in any browser.
- `dragTo()` covers mouse-event-driven drag (custom sortable lists,
  sliders) — not native HTML5 drag-and-drop (`draggable="true"` +
  `DataTransfer`), which needs a real user gesture in most browsers.
- Every event dispatched is genuine but `isTrusted: false` — no page-level
  JS can change that. Most sites don't check `event.isTrusted`; a few
  (deliberate anti-automation logic) do and will silently ignore it.

# Recorder: page-pilot-recorder

Turns real clicks/typing/selecting into the exact step array the core
expects. Only listens to real (`isTrusted`) DOM events — never dispatches
anything itself, the mirror image of the core engine.

## Usage

```js
import { PagePilotRecorder } from 'page-pilot/recorder'

const recorder = new PagePilotRecorder({ ui: true }) // floating start/stop/copy panel
recorder.start()
// ...person interacts with the page...
const steps = recorder.stop()
```

## What gets recorded

click, typing (buffered until blur, not per-keystroke — Enter inside a
`<textarea>`/`contenteditable` is just a newline, not a shortcut, so
multi-line text isn't cut off after the first line), native `<select>`
(single/multi), checkbox/radio (as `check` steps), non-character keys and
modifier shortcuts (Ctrl+A etc., as `pressKey`), debounced window/
container scrolling, drag gestures past a distance threshold (skips
likely text-selection drags), and opening a custom dropdown + picking an
option (auto-merged into one `chooseOption` step via a `MutationObserver`,
instead of two separate clicks).

**Never recorded, on any site, no matter what:** password fields — a
hard, non-configurable rule.

**Not recorded, needs a person to decide:** `waitFor()` steps (a
`gapBefore` field on the following step hints that a pause happened, in
case something was loading asynchronously) and hover gestures (too hard
to distinguish from incidental mouse movement reliably).

## Selector generation

Every target is generated by trying, in priority order: `id` (disambiguated
by position if duplicated — common on messier sites), `data-testid`/`-cy`/
`-test`/`-qa`, any other `data-*` attribute, `aria-label`, `name`, visible
text content for buttons/links (also disambiguated by position if
duplicated), non-utility class names, then a structural `nth-of-type` path
as a last resort. A step that had to fall back to position-disambiguation
or the structural path carries `fragile: true`.

Interactions inside a same-origin iframe get a `frame` field automatically.

## Config (defaults)

```js
new PagePilotRecorder({
  ui: true, scrollSettleDelay: 250,
  mergeChooseOption: true, chooseOptionMergeWindow: 4000,
  recordDragTo: true, dragThreshold: 10,
  waitHintThreshold: 1200,
  recordIframes: true,
  onStep: null, onWaitHint: null,
})
```

# Skills: page-pilot-skills

Turns a recorded step array into a reusable "skill": a short description,
a list of named parameters, and the original steps with concrete values
swapped for `{{parameter}}` placeholders — so the same recording can be
run again later with different values. **No AI here at all** — a person
picks what becomes a parameter, names it, confirms before saving, and
provides real values again later to run it. Retrieval (matching a new
instruction to the right skill) and natural-language value extraction are
a separate, later layer, not part of this one.

## Usage

```js
import { showArchivePanel, listSkills, fillSkillParameters } from 'page-pilot/skills'

const steps = recorder.stop()
const skill = await showArchivePanel(steps) // null if "one-time use" was picked; saves itself otherwise

// later, to run a saved skill with new values:
const saved = listSkills()[0]
const filledSteps = fillSkillParameters(saved, { 'Last Name': 'Tanaka', 'Department': 'Engineering' })
await cursor.run(filledSteps)
```

## What gets detected as a parameter candidate

Every `type` step's `text`, `select` step's `value`, and `check` step's
`checked` state, each with a suggested name tried in this order: a
`<label for="...">`, a wrapping `<label>`, `aria-label`, `placeholder`,
then `name`. `select` values suggest checked by default; `check` states
and values over 200 characters suggest unchecked (usually a fixed part of
the flow or free-form text, not something worth re-parameterizing).

## What's saved, and what deliberately isn't

**Example values are never persisted** — only parameter *names*, even if
a draft happens to carry one alongside. Skills are scoped per domain
(`location.hostname` by default). `fragile` and `highRisk` (checked
against common dangerous-action words — delete/submit/pay/transfer, in
English and Chinese — pre-filling, not enforcing, the panel's checkbox)
get set automatically but never block saving.

## API

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `detectParameters(steps)` | Scan a step array, return candidates with suggested names |
| `hasFragileSteps(steps)` / `isHighRisk(steps)` | Heuristic checks used to pre-fill the panel's warnings |
| `buildSkillDraft(description, steps, acceptedParams)` | Build a draft with placeholders substituted in |
| `saveSkill` / `listSkills` / `getSkill` / `deleteSkill` | `localStorage`-backed storage, scoped per domain |
| `fillSkillParameters(skill, values)` | Substitute real values back in, ready for `cursor.run()` |
| `showArchivePanel(steps, options?)` | The full review UI; saves itself, resolves with the record or `null` |

# Toolkit: the bookmarklet

Ties the other three layers together with a floating panel, injected by a
bookmarklet — see "Quick start" at the top for the install link.

## What it does

- **Start recording** / **Stop** — records via the recorder layer; Stop
  also opens the skills archive panel (save as a reusable skill, or use it
  just this once — either way, the JSON box below keeps the *originally
  recorded* values, so Run/Copy work immediately regardless).
- **My Skills** — everything saved for the current site. **Run** opens a
  small form (one field per parameter) to fill in new values; high-risk
  skills confirm first; **Delete** removes one, with confirmation.
- **Run** / **Copy** — run the JSON in the box (recorded, pasted, or
  hand-written — recording isn't required), or copy it elsewhere.
- Automatically handles a step that reloads a same-origin iframe
  (`autoWaitForIframeReload: true`), and refuses to click through a still-
  open modal's backdrop (`verifyClickable: true`) — both on by default
  here, since there's no practical way to hand-edit a wait step into
  recorded/pasted JSON from this panel.

## Security notes

- A page you run this on gets exactly the same access your browser
  session already has to it — same as any bookmarklet or user script.
- The panel renders inside a closed Shadow DOM, so the host page's CSS
  can't break it and it can't leak styles onto the host page.
- Saved skills live in that site's own `localStorage` — clearing the
  browser's site data for it removes them too.
- The bookmarklet pins this repo to a specific version tag (see
  `demo/install.html`) — updating means re-dragging the bookmark, so an
  already-installed one keeps behaving the same way until you choose to.
- Some sites' Content-Security-Policy blocks the external `<script>` this
  injects entirely — the bookmarklet shows an alert if that happens.
  That's the site's own security setting; a bookmarklet has no privilege
  to work around it (a browser extension would).

## Testing

```bash
npm install
npm test               # all four layers
npm run test:core      # just one layer
npm run test:recorder
npm run test:skills
npm run test:toolkit
```

Runs real-browser suites (Playwright + Chromium via `@sparticuz/chromium`
— its npm package ships the browser binary inside its own tarball instead
of a separate download step, which matters in sandboxed environments that
can't reach Playwright's own CDN). Real-browser testing caught several
bugs across this project's history that a simulated DOM environment
(jsdom) passed cleanly — cross-realm `instanceof` failing for iframe
content, `activeElement` checks scoped to the wrong document, `el.click()`
never simulating `mousedown` at all, and more — each documented in
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) where it was found.
