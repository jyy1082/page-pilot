# page-pilot

**English** · [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

**Version 0.13.0** · see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history

A dependency-free visualization layer for automated webpage operations.

It does **not** decide what to click or type — that's your own automation
logic (your own selectors, or whatever drives your automation). This library
only animates a virtual cursor moving to a target, plays a click / input
feedback effect, draws a highlight border around whatever was just touched,
and lets your executor perform the real DOM action underneath.

Built for the common case of adding a "here's what's happening, and where"
visual layer on top of any automated webpage interaction, without pulling in
a UI framework or animation library.

## Demo

**[Open the live demo](https://jyy1082.github.io/page-pilot/demo.html)** —
press "Run full demo" to watch the library drive a real form: typing, a
native `<select>`, a custom dropdown, a checkbox, scrolling a container, and
a final click, with a highlight border left on every field it touched.

You can also open [`demo.html`](./demo.html) directly from a local clone —
no build step needed, it's plain ES modules.

## Features

- Animated virtual cursor that moves to each target before acting
- Click ripple and press feedback
- Typing animation that works in native inputs/textareas (via native setter,
  so it works through React/Vue controlled inputs) and in `contenteditable`
  elements (rich-text editors, custom div-based inputs)
- Native `<select>` support, including multi-select
- Checkbox/radio/switch support (including ARIA-based custom toggles) that only clicks when the state actually needs to change
- Custom (div/li-based) dropdown menu support via `chooseOption`
- Keyboard input: `pressKey()` for Enter/Escape/arrows/etc., with modifier keys
- Hover/unhover for tooltips and hover-triggered menus
- Drag and drop for mouse-event-based sortable lists, sliders, and custom drag widgets
- `waitFor()` polls for asynchronously-loaded content instead of guessing a fixed delay
- Page and container scrolling, with scroll-settle detection and an optional direction indicator
- Optional pulsing border around the whole viewport (or a specific container via `pageGlowTarget`) while any step is running — a clear "the system is driving this" signal for the person watching. Real mouse clicks inside it are blocked by default (`blockInteraction`, with an escape-hatch allowlist via `pointerBlockAllowlist`), and an optional status message (`pageGlowMessage`) appears and disappears together with it
- Same-origin iframe support — target elements inside an iframe with `{ selector, frame }`, with automatic coordinate translation for the cursor/ripple/highlight visuals
- Persistent highlight borders on every acted-on element (on by default,
  cleared explicitly or via `highlightDuration`), auto-repositioned on scroll/resize
- Every operation is queued, so animations and actions never overlap
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Zero dependencies, ~5KB

## Install

```bash
npm install page-pilot
```

Or just copy `page-pilot.js` directly into your project.

## Usage

```js
import { PagePilot } from 'page-pilot'

const cursor = new PagePilot({
  onExecuteClick: (el) => el.click(),
})

await cursor.click(document.querySelector('#submit'))
await cursor.type(document.querySelector('#name'), 'Acme Corp')
await cursor.select(document.querySelector('#country'), 'US')
await cursor.check(document.querySelector('#agree'), true)
await cursor.chooseOption('#menu-trigger', '.menu-item[data-value="pro"]')
await cursor.scroll(null, { amount: 600 })       // scroll window down 600px
await cursor.scroll('#panel', { to: 'bottom' })  // scroll a container to its bottom

cursor.clearHighlight('#name')  // remove one persisted highlight
cursor.clearHighlights()        // remove all of them
cursor.destroy()
```

### "The system is doing this" page glow

```js
const cursor = new PagePilot({ showPageGlow: true })
// Now the whole viewport gets a pulsing colored border for as long as any
// click/type/select/etc. is running, and it fades out once the queue is idle.
```

Wrap a specific container instead of the whole page:

```js
const cursor = new PagePilot({ showPageGlow: true, pageGlowTarget: '#chat-panel' })
// The glow hugs #chat-panel's current bounding box instead of the viewport,
// and stays aligned to it if the page scrolls or resizes.
```

By default, real mouse clicks inside the glow area are blocked while it's
showing — so the person watching can't interfere with automation in
progress — and it comes with an optional status message that appears and
disappears together with the glow:

```js
const cursor = new PagePilot({
  showPageGlow: true,
  pageGlowTarget: '#demo-card',
  pageGlowMessage: 'Automation running — please wait…',
  // Keep the Stop button clickable even though it's inside the blocked area:
  pointerBlockAllowlist: ['#stop-btn'],
})

// Or opt out of blocking entirely and just show the visual glow:
const cursor2 = new PagePilot({ showPageGlow: true, blockInteraction: false })
```

While the glow is showing, real mouse input inside that area is blocked by
default (`blockInteraction: true`) — so the person watching can't click/type
into the page while automation is driving it, and it releases automatically
the instant the glow fades:

```js
const cursor = new PagePilot({ showPageGlow: true, blockInteraction: false })
// Real clicks/input still reach the page even while the glow is showing.
```

Add a small status label pinned to the top of the glow area:

```js
const cursor = new PagePilot({
  showPageGlow: true,
  pageGlowMessage: 'Automation running — please wait…',
})
// Shown only while a step is running, and disappears together with the glow.
```

### Batch steps

```js
await cursor.run([
  { type: 'type', target: '#email', text: 'a@b.com' },
  { type: 'select', target: '#country', value: 'US' },
  { type: 'check', target: '#agree-terms', checked: true },
  { type: 'chooseOption', target: '#plan-trigger', option: '.plan-option[data-value="pro"]' },
  { type: 'scroll', target: '#panel', options: { to: 'bottom' } },
  { type: 'click', target: '#submit' },
])
```

### Stopping mid-sequence

```js
const runPromise = cursor.run([ /* a long list of steps */ ])

stopButton.addEventListener('click', () => cursor.stop())

await runPromise // resolves quietly even if stop() cut it short
```

### Keyboard, hover, drag, and waiting for async content

```js
await cursor.pressKey('#search', 'Enter')
await cursor.pressKey('#dropdown', 'ArrowDown')
await cursor.pressKey(null, 'Escape') // sends to whatever currently has focus

await cursor.hover('#info-icon')   // triggers mouseenter/mouseover (tooltips, hover menus)
await cursor.unhover()             // triggers mouseleave/mouseout

await cursor.dragTo('#item-1', '#drop-zone')          // element to element
await cursor.dragTo('#slider-handle', { x: 400, y: 120 }) // element to a raw point

await cursor.waitFor('#async-result', { timeout: 8000 }) // polls instead of guessing a fixed delay

// Wait for something to disappear instead of appear — useful right before a
// step that depends on an earlier, about-to-be-replaced element actually
// having been removed first (common on pages that update content
// asynchronously without a full navigation, where the next step can
// otherwise run before that update lands and hit the stale old element):
await cursor.click('#save-btn')
await cursor.waitFor('#save-btn', { state: 'gone', timeout: 3000 })
await cursor.waitFor('#saved-confirmation')
```

### Hooking up to your own executor

If your automation already has its own way of clicking/typing (a custom DOM
controller, a browser-extension bridge, whatever), just point the hooks at it
instead of the default `el.click()` / native-setter input:

```js
const cursor = new PagePilot({
  onExecuteClick: (el) => myController.clickElement(indexOf(el)),
  onExecuteInput: (el, text) => myController.inputText(indexOf(el), text),
})
```

## API

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `click(target, label?)` | Move to and click an element |
| `type(target, text, label?)` | Move to, focus, and type into an input/textarea/contenteditable element |
| `select(target, value, label?)` | Set a native `<select>`'s value (array = multi-select) |
| `check(target, checked, label?)` | Set a checkbox, radio, or ARIA switch (`role="switch"`/`aria-checked`) to a specific checked state |
| `chooseOption(trigger, option, options?)` | Open a custom dropdown and click an option |
| `scroll(target, options?)` | Scroll the window or a container (`{ amount }` or `{ to: 'top'\|'bottom' }`) |
| `pressKey(target, key, options?)` | Send a key press (Enter, Escape, arrows, etc.), with optional modifiers |
| `hover(target, label?)` | Move to a target and dispatch hover events (mouseenter/mouseover) |
| `unhover(label?)` | Leave whatever's currently hovered via `hover()` |
| `dragTo(source, target, options?)` | Drag from a source to a target element or `{x, y}` point |
| `waitFor(target, options?)` | Poll until a selector/predicate matches a visible element (or, with `{ state: 'gone' }`, until it disappears), instead of a fixed delay |
| `waitForFrameReload(frameSelector, options?)` | Wait for a same-origin iframe's own content to reload/navigate (its document identity changes) — no need to know anything about the new content |
| `moveTo(target)` | Move the cursor without acting |
| `step(target, action, label?)` | Run custom logic while still getting the cursor animation |
| `run(steps)` | Run an ordered array of steps of any of the above types, then automatically hide the cursor dot |
| `stop()` | Immediately abort whatever's running and drop anything still queued — the instance stays usable right after, no reset needed |
| `hideCursor()` | Hide the cursor dot (e.g. once a sequence of individual calls is done) |
| `showCursor()` | Show the cursor dot again (also happens automatically on the next move/click/type/etc.) |
| `clearHighlight(target)` | Remove one element's highlight box |
| `clearHighlights()` | Remove every active highlight box |
| `destroy()` | Remove the cursor, all highlights, and event listeners |

`target` accepts a `Element`, a CSS selector string, or an object combining
`selector` with `frame` (for an element inside a same-origin iframe, see
"iframe support" below), `index` (to pick the Nth match of a selector
that isn't unique on its own, see "Duplicate ids" below), and/or `text`
(to match a button/link by its visible text content, see "Matching by
text" below) — these are the shapes
[page-pilot-recorder](https://github.com/jyy1082/page-pilot-recorder)
produces automatically, so recorded steps replay with no manual adjustment.

## Duplicate ids

Real (especially older or messier) sites often have more than one element
sharing the same `id` — invalid HTML, but browsers don't stop anyone from
doing it. `{ selector, index }` picks the Nth match instead of assuming the
first one is the right one:

```js
await cursor.click({ selector: '[id="row-action"]', index: 2 }) // the third one
```

This is what page-pilot-recorder generates automatically once it notices a
recorded element's `id` doesn't uniquely identify it — you shouldn't
usually need to write this by hand, but it's there if you're constructing
steps yourself.

## Matching by text

Native CSS has no "match by visible text" selector, so `{ selector, text }`
fills that gap for buttons and links — often the most human-recognizable
and redesign-resistant identifier they have, especially when there's no
id/aria-label/data attribute at all:

```js
await cursor.click({ selector: 'button', text: 'Submit' })

// several elements sharing the exact same text combine with index, same as duplicate ids:
await cursor.click({ selector: 'button', text: 'Delete', index: 2 }) // the third "Delete" button
```

This is what page-pilot-recorder generates automatically for a button/link
it can't otherwise identify. `text` and `index` both combine freely with
`frame` too.

## iframe support

Steps recorded inside a **same-origin** iframe (or written by hand) can
carry a `frame` field — an iframe selector, or an array of them for nested
iframes — and `run()` resolves the element in the right document
automatically:

```js
await cursor.run([
  { type: 'click', target: '#confirm-btn', frame: '#payment-iframe' },
])

// or call a method directly with the { selector, frame } shape:
await cursor.click({ selector: '#confirm-btn', frame: '#payment-iframe' })

// nested iframes: outermost to innermost
await cursor.type({ selector: '#field', frame: ['#outer-iframe', '#inner-iframe'] }, 'hello')

// index and frame combine when an element is both inside an iframe and
// among a set of duplicate ids there:
await cursor.click({ selector: '[id="dup"]', index: 1, frame: '#payment-iframe' })
```

The cursor dot, click ripples, and highlight boxes all correctly account
for the iframe's own position on the page — `getBoundingClientRect()` is
relative to an element's own window, not the top page, so page-pilot
translates iframe-relative coordinates into top-level ones before drawing
anything.

If a click causes an iframe to navigate or reload its own content (common
for embedded payment widgets or multi-step forms — the top page's URL
never changes, only the iframe's), `waitFor({ selector, frame }, ...)`
correctly follows it through the reload instead of getting stuck polling
the old, torn-down document. This works the same way whether the
triggering click happened inside the iframe or on the parent page (e.g. a
"refresh" button on the parent page, or a `<form target="iframe-name">`
submission) — only the iframe's own content needs to be what's changing:

```js
await cursor.click({ selector: '#next-step-btn', frame: '#payment-iframe' })
await cursor.waitFor({ selector: '#step-2-marker', frame: '#payment-iframe' })
```

That approach needs you to know a specific element in the new content to
wait for. If you'd rather not — or the exact race is "the next step ran
before the iframe had even started reloading, so it hit a button in the
stale, about-to-be-replaced content" — `waitForFrameReload()` waits for the
iframe's own document identity to actually change instead, which needs no
knowledge of what the new content looks like at all:

```js
await cursor.click('#refresh-iframe-btn')   // wherever this button lives — inside the iframe or on the parent page, either way
await cursor.waitForFrameReload('#payment-iframe')
await cursor.click({ selector: '#new-btn', frame: '#payment-iframe' })
```

**Cross-origin iframes can't be targeted at all** — reading or resolving
anything inside one is blocked by the browser itself (the same reason no
browser automation tool can reach into a cross-origin iframe without
special server-side cooperation), not a limitation specific to this library.

})
```

## Framework compatibility

Works against React, Vue, and other framework-rendered UIs the same as
plain HTML — the library only ever touches the real DOM, and every
framework's UI ends up as real DOM nodes at runtime.

- **Clicks** dispatch a real `el.click()`, which bubbles and is caught by
  React's delegated event listeners exactly like a real mouse click.
- **Typing and `select()`** go through the element's native property setter
  rather than plain assignment, specifically to work around React's (and
  some other frameworks') controlled-component value tracking — plain
  `el.value = x` gets silently ignored by React's change detection even
  after dispatching an `input`/`change` event, so this bypass is required
  for `onChange` to actually fire.
- Component libraries (MUI, Ant Design, etc.) that render a checkbox/switch
  as a styled `<input>` under the hood work through `check()` as-is; ones
  that render a fully custom `<div role="switch">` work through `check()`'s
  ARIA support (see above).

## Known limits

- A native `<select>`'s open option list is rendered by the OS/browser, not
  the DOM, so only the click on the select box itself is animated.
- File inputs (`<input type="file">`) cannot be set programmatically for
  security reasons in any browser.
- Native date/color pickers have the same browser-drawn-popup limitation as
  `<select>`.
- `dragTo()` covers mouse-event-based drag (most sortable lists, sliders,
  custom drag widgets) — it doesn't drive native HTML5 drag-and-drop
  (`draggable="true"` + `DataTransfer`), which needs a trusted user gesture
  in most browsers. Canvas-based widgets also aren't covered directly; use
  `step()` to write custom logic while still getting the cursor animation
  for free.
- `pressKey()` dispatches real KeyboardEvents any listener will see, but —
  like `click()` — it won't trigger a browser's own built-in default action
  for a key (e.g. Enter alone won't auto-submit a form unless the page's own
  JS explicitly does that).
- A "form" built entirely from generic `<div>`s with no semantic markup at
  all (no `role`/`aria-checked`, no `contenteditable`, no real `<input>`
  anywhere) has no standard state to read or write — `click()` still works
  for anything that's just a click, but for anything stateful, use `step()`
  to read/write whatever custom attribute or class your component uses.
- This only moves a *visual* cursor — it cannot move the user's real, physical
  mouse pointer (browsers don't expose that capability to page scripts), and
  clicks are dispatched as synthetic (`isTrusted: false`) events.

## Testing

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Runs a real-browser regression suite (Playwright + Chromium, obtained via
`@sparticuz/chromium` since it ships the browser inside its own npm
tarball — see
[page-pilot-recorder's README](https://github.com/jyy1082/page-pilot-recorder#testing)
for why that specific detour exists). This matters especially for the
same-origin iframe support: each iframe has its own separate JavaScript
realm with its own `Element`/`Document` constructors, and coordinate
translation between an iframe's viewport and the top page's needs to be
verified against a real browser's actual layout — a simulated DOM
environment doesn't reproduce either of those closely enough to catch
mistakes there.
